development plan
================

need 3-4 main entities.

 - price-daemon.py
    + gets current price of N different trade pairs
    + updates larger file of all historical data
    + creates/overwrites temporary current price file
    + constantly running
    o mainly written, small updates to get_basic_trade.py

 - observer.py (class)
    + 'observes' trend with specific set of parameters
    + initially loads set of historical data
    + after initial load, takes current price and adds it to the stack
      while popping the earliest value of the stack
    + while updating price info, checks if new price is a min or max
    + every 60-600 updates, write observer object to file, indexed by parameters
    ? keep track of anything else other than current state

 - overlord.py (class)
    + manages multiple observers
    + this will allow us to run many observers in parallel
    + loads some file with list of parameter sets
    + creates instance of observer with each parameter set
    + loads current price into each observer
    + wait until time to update

 - trader.py (class)
    + This will be nearly identical to observer.py but will have option to
      act (trade/alert) when extremum is reached.



specifics
=========

-----------
observer.py
-----------

__init__(prices,smooth,ma,md,%,tols,trader=bool):
  o fix parameters to this instance
    price
    price_smooth
    d1
    d1_smooth
    d2
    d2_smooth
    - all of these values are windowed to smooth/ma/md ?
    trader # if this observer is going to act or just watch
  o load prices
  o find Initial derivatives/smooth functions

update(new price,new time):
  price.pop()/.push(newPrice)
  smooth
  differentiate/smooth
  current_time = new time
find_extrema():
  same as previously defined

step()
  check if there's an updated price file
  if there's a new price:
    update()
    find_extrema()
    if trader: action/alert
    if counter % 60 == 0 : backup brief
    if counter % 360 == 0 : backup full


-----------
overlord.py
-----------
 load parameter list file
 create observers for each parameter set in list
 loop:
   load current price
   update all observers in parameter set  
   wait
